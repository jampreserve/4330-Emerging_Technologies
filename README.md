These teams must change their methods of communication and refine their skills specific to that task. Finally, MSA calls for a brand-new, intricate application architecture, which has an effect on networking, security models, and runtime activities. Overall, transitioning to Microservices carries a cultural impact to a companyâ€™s previous work environment and requires certain prerequisites to be met prior to its implementation.
